# Arena About
Arena About is the frontend of [SIESGSTarena](http://arena.siesgst.ac.in/). In this version, we have tried to redesign the UI. 

## About The Project

You can have a look at our [Arena About]()
The project is focused on providing a good UI to our users in order to give a clear picture about SIESGSTarena . We have used HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP to design the about page.

### Project Structure

The project structure is based on the idea of keeping all the components and assets required by a route in its own separate folder.
The entire project is divided into 5 modules:

1. common: This module contains the components which are common across all the routes. e.g. The NavigationBar.
1. menu: This menu contains links to the sections present in the web page.
1. Welcome and Mission : This section contains the basic information and the mission of SIESGSTarena.
1. More about arena and Our Story: This section contains all the information about arena.
1. Our Competitions: This section contains all the information related to competitions conducted by SIESGSTarena.
